# Password Generator

## Purpose 
A program that generates passwords with optional entries for those who need them.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Website 
https://deivrs60.github.io/password-generator/

## Github Repository Link 
https://github.com/deivrs60/password-generator

## Current Bugs
* If 'Generate Password' Button is pressed without refreshing the page, all previous selected entries will carry over.
* When console.log is executed, "undefined" appears in front of the chosen entry string. So if the lowercase option was declined, those "undefined" letters will appear in the console as so, randomized, of course. Tested right before this merge and it worked fine, but it was something that was noticed during the project build. 

** Will fix these eventually! :)
